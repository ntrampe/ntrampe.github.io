          In addition to creative filming, editing, and social media management, I automated repetitive tasks, such as
          responding to comments, with Python and OpenAI's GPT API. I designed and developed a promotional <a

          I was an iOS software engineer at Bending Spoons in Milan, Italy. I developed features for <a
            href="https://alightmotion.com/">AlightMotion</a>, a native motion graphics iOS application in Swift.
          During my time here, I refactored the application, feature by feature, to implement more scalable
          architectures and practices such as <a
            href="https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture">Swift Composable Architecture</a>.
          Additionally, I implemented the design for paywalls, and other features using SwiftUI. I introduced iOS
          tooling such as Tuist, and internal tools for analytics and running experiments.
          After my wife's immigrant visa was approved, we moved back to the United States.

          I was a freelance software engineer remotely based in Vietnam.
          After moving to reunite with my wife during during the pandemic, I spent most of my time developing my skills
          in Flutter, and UI/UX.
          Freelancing with Flutter has given me the opportunity to master reactive programming, build robust and
          scalable backend services with Firebase, and learn about app marketing, all while wearing the hat of a UI/UX
          designer.

          I was a software engineer on two Google Maps teams.
          I developed features for the Google Maps Navigation iOS platform team.
          I contributed to launching <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/new-sense-direction-live-view/">Live

          I designed, developed, advocated for, and mentored best practices for the architecture for a native iPad

          I helped conduct global research studies to provide a better Google Maps experience.
          I also developed critical COVID-19 awareness functionality.

          I was fortunate enough to have three internships along the way. My first was at Garmin developing software for
